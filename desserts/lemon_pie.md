# Lemon pie

## Ingredients
- 1 cup white sugar (or fake sugar, but it's really a shame)
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups water
- 2 lemons, juiced and zested
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 egg yolks, beaten
- 1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked

# Instructions
- Step 1: Prepare the pie crust
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to an 1/8-inch-thick circle. Transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the dough to 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the plate. Flute the edge. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Editor’s Tip: To flute the edge, position your index finger’s knuckle on the edge of the pie facing inward. Then place your other thumb and index finger on the inside edge. Press the crust towards the knuckle, and pinch to form a V. Continue all the way around the pie crust.
- Step 2: Blind bake the pie crust
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line the crust with a double thickness of foil. Fill with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice. Bake on a lower oven rack until the edge is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and weights. Bake until the bottom is golden brown, three to six minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. Reduce the oven setting to 350°.
- Step 3: Prepare the lemon filling

In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, all-purpose flour and salt. Gradually stir in the water. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Reduce the heat. Cook and stir for two minutes more. Remove from the heat.

Return the tempered egg yolks to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cook and stir for two minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter, lemon juice and grated lemon zest. Whisk until smooth. Pour the hot lemon filling into the pie crust.
Editor’s Tip: No one wants scrambled eggs in their lemon meringue pie! Create a smooth texture by tempering the eggs first. That process adds a small portion of the hot mixture to the yolks to raise their temperature slowly. Then, they’ll blend into the lemon filling without scrambling.
- Step 4: Prepare the meringue
In a bowl, beat the egg whites and salt until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Gradually beat in the sugar until soft peaks form.
Editor’s Tip: When making meringue, be sure there are no yolks—not even a drop!—in your egg whites. Even a little fat can compromise the whites’ ability to stiffen, and the meringue won’t become fluffy and light. Wipe the mixing bowl clean, too, so it contains no residual oils.
